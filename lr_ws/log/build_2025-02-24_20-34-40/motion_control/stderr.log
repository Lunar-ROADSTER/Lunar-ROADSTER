[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findplanning.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "planning",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "planning" with any
  of the following names:

    planningConfig.cmake
    planning-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "planning" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "planning_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "planning" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
