[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:18 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcg_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "cg_msgs", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "cg_msgs" with any
  of the following names:

    cg_msgsConfig.cmake
    cg_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "cg_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "cg_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "cg_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
