/**
 * @file bayes_filter.cpp
 * @brief Implements a simple Bayesian update filter for per-cell elevation and variance estimation in elevation maps.
 *
 * This class maintains an elevation estimate and variance for a single grid cell. When a new
 * measurement is received, it applies a Bayesian update step (Kalman gain style) to refine the
 * elevation estimate and reduce uncertainty. Variance is bounded below by a configurable
 * `LOCALIZATION_VARIANCE` to prevent overconfidence.
 *
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @date 2025-08-09
 *
 * Maintainer: Boxiang (William) Fu
 * Team: Lunar ROADSTER
 * Team Members: Ankit Aggarwal, Deepam Ameria, Bhaswanth Ayapilla, Simson Dâ€™Souza, Boxiang (William) Fu

 *
 * Parameters:
 * - LOCALIZATION_VARIANCE: [float] Minimum allowable variance after an update.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Initializes cell elevation to 0.0 and variance to 100.0.
 * - Kalman gain `k_t` is computed as `sigma_hat / (sigma_hat + sigma_t)`.
 * - For the first measurement (cell elevation = 0.0), `k_t` is forced to 1.0 so the measurement fully replaces the estimate.
 * - Variance is reduced after each update but never goes below `LOCALIZATION_VARIANCE`.
 * - `getCellElevation()` and `getCellVariance()` provide read-only access to the current state.
