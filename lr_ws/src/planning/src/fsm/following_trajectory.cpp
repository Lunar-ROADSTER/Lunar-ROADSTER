/**
 * @file following_trajectory.cpp
 * @brief Following Trajectory state implementation for finite state machine in planning module.
 *
 * This module implements the Following Trajectory state, which manages trajectory execution by checking if the goal is reached and updating the state accordingly.
 * It supports running the state to monitor the current goal pose and transition to the next state when the goal is achieved.
 *
 * The implementation uses a simple FSM mechanism:
 *   - runState(): Checks if the goal is reached and updates the preceding signal and current state.
 *
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @date 2025-07-19
 *
 * Maintainer: Boxiang (William) Fu
 * Team: Lunar ROADSTER  
 * Team Members: Ankit Aggarwal, Deepam Ameria, Bhaswanth Ayapilla, Simson Dâ€™Souza, Boxiang (William) Fu
 *
 * Inputs:
 * - current_goal_pose [lr_msgs/msg/Pose2D]: A Pose2D message representing the current goal position and orientation.
 * - goal_reached [bool]: A boolean indicating whether the goal has been reached.
 * - current_goalPose_type [std::string]: A string describing the type of the current goal pose.
 *
 * Methods:
 * - runState(): Executes the trajectory following logic and handles state transitions.
