/**
 * @file goals_remaining.cpp
 * @brief Oversees the processing of pending goals within the planning FSM.
 *
 * This file delivers mechanisms to track and handle ongoing goals, facilitating sequential execution and state shifts when goals are exhausted or advanced.
 * It prioritizes efficient goal management, including updates to poses and signals for smooth mission flow.
 *
 * Notable aspects:
 *   - runState(): Orchestrates goal selection, removal, and FSM transitions.
 *
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @date 2025-07-19
 *
 * Maintainer: Boxiang (William) Fu
 * Team: Lunar ROADSTER  
 * Team Members: Ankit Aggarwal, Deepam Ameria, Bhaswanth Ayapilla, Simson Dâ€™Souza, Boxiang (William) Fu
 *
 * Inputs:
 * - current_goal_poses [std::vector<lr_msgs::msg::Pose2D>&]: Collection of remaining goal poses to manage.
 * - current_goal_pose [lr_msgs::msg::Pose2D&]: The active goal pose under processing.
 * - current_goalPose_types [std::vector<std::string>&]: Types associated with the remaining goals.
 * - current_goalPose_type [std::string&]: Type of the current goal being handled.
 *
 * Methods:
 * - runState(): Manages goal processing and state changes; outputs: None (void), but updates inputs by reference and modifies FSM states.
