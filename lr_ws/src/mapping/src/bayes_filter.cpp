/**
 * @file bayes_filter.cpp
 * @brief Implements a simple Bayesian update filter for cell elevation and variance estimation.
 *
 * This class maintains a single cell's elevation estimate and its associated uncertainty (variance).
 * Upon receiving a new measurement, it applies a Bayesian update step using a Kalman gain formulation
 * to refine the elevation estimate and reduce uncertainty, bounded by a minimum localization variance.
 *
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @date 2025-08-09
 *
 * Maintainer: Boxiang (William) Fu
 * Team: Lunar ROADSTER
 * Team Members: Ankit Aggarwal, Deepam Ameria, Bhaswanth Ayapilla, Simson Dâ€™Souza, Boxiang (William) Fu

 * Services:

 *
 * Parameters:
 * - LOCALIZATION_VARIANCE: [float] Minimum allowable variance after an update.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Initializes cell elevation to 0.0 and variance to 100.0.
 * - Uses a Kalman gain `k_t` to blend the prior estimate (`z_hat`) and the new measurement (`z_t`).
 * - If the cell elevation is still at its initial value (0.0), the Kalman gain is forced to 1.0,
 *   making the first measurement fully overwrite the prior.
 * - The variance is reduced after each update but clamped to `LOCALIZATION_VARIANCE`.
 * - Provides getters for elevation and variance for use by other mapping modules.
